#### Some history

- I grew up in Southern California in a loving family. My parents pushed me hard, because they knew I could acheive more. 

- I went to Laguna Hills High School, wreslted, and tried hard in my academics. 

- I attended University of California, Santa Barbara and majored in Business Economics. 

- After University, I went chasing the dream in Los Angeles and the business side of the Entertainment Industry, only to realize that every Producer and Director I met was unhappy, divorced, and living job to job. This was not the life I envisioned. 

- Ryan: "Mom, I'm moving to Idaho." Mom: "Ok son, see you in a couple months."

- Once in Idaho, I found my passion for tech. I found an entry level position as an Application Engineer and worked my way up. 

- While working fulltime, I received my Computer Science degree. Then, after about 10 years of professional working, I went on to complete my MBA...

- Fast forward to today... (still in Idaho P.S - Mom was wrong) I continue to learn and push myself everyday. I am married to my beautiful wife, Sarah, have two sons (Griffin, and Grey) and push hard everyday to show them that, with effort, grit, and determination... you can achieve anything. 

- //Never.Stop.Pushing.

#### I dream of

- always finding new ways to inspire myself and others
- always learning more
- being the best role model for my boys
